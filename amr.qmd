# Anti-Microbial Resistance {#sec-amr}

The ecology and behavior of hosts helps establish the selective environment for pathogens.

## The Crisis of Antimicrobial Resistance

Why do we have a crisis? A very real contributor to the problem relates to the economic incentives for pharmaceutical companies [@kremer_snyder2015].

Consider a population of 100 people, 90 of whom have a low disease risk, say 10%. The remaining ten have 100% chance of getting infected. The infection generates harm equal to the loss of $100 and both treatment pharmaceuticals or vaccines are costless to produce, administer, and are 100% effective. Assume people are risk neutral and economically rational (big assumptions, I know).

This means 19 people will get infected on average.

Low-risk population loses an expected $10 (10% chance x $100 loss).
High-risk population loses $100.

Economic theory tells us that the low-risk people should be willing to pay $10 for a vaccine. Note also that the Pharma company doesnâ€™t know a priori who is high-vs.-low risk. This means $10 x 100 = $1000 revenue.

However, economic theory also tells us that anyone infected (regardless of their subpopulation) should be willing to pay $100 to treat their disease. This means $100 x 19 = $1900.
